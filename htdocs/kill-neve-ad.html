<h1>How to kill the Neve ad</h1>

<p>It is not a secret that I am a proud user of the Themeisle Neve theme.
    I appreciate the Neve theme developers for their hard work and for
    providing the theme for free, but I need the space in my footer for
    other things.</p>
<p>This page has a simple JavaScript snippet that removes the Neve ad.
    You can still see it if you view the page source, but if you use
    your browser's inspect function, the entire ad is gone.
    It is not hidden, but cleanly removed from the browser's model
    of the page.</p>
<p>It relies on finding an anchor element with a certain href in it,
    and then removing its parent element. If they change their design,
    <span style="color: darkred; text-decoration: underline;">this script might also need to change</span>.</p>
<p>You don't have to put the script in the head element, which is good for me
    because on my WordPress site I can't alter the head as easily as
    I put content in the body.</p>
</p>

</div>

<script>
console.log('Script section is running');
// When the page is fully rendered, find the anchor element that has a href attribute containing "neve" and remove its parent element
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    var neveAd = document.querySelector('a[href="https://themeisle.com/themes/neve/"]');
    if (neveAd) {
        neveAd.parentElement.remove();
    }
});
</script>

<div id="footer">
<p>This is the footer. There should not be an ad here &#128071; anymore.</p>
